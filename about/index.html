                            As a child of the 80's, the commercialized Internet and I grew up together. I found web development in the late 90's to be an empowering craft as a creator of content and tools. <!--mobile--> And through every passing platform and technology in those years, the goal has remained building products with great experiences.

                            I found design through front-end web development. I truly began to realize design as a problem-solving discipline through my freelance work for various nonprofit organizations at the University of California in Berkeley, and more formally during the human-computer interaction course through the Computer Science department.
